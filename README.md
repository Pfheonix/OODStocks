# OODStocks

Patterns To implement
   
   Factory:
        Stock Creation
   
   Singleton:
        Market
        (We could potentially simulate a stock market crash. It'd be pretty funny)
   
   Iterator:
        Updating Stock Prices/listing them off
   
   Command/Observer:
        Use to create the GUI
        
 GUI:
    Have a graph to represent stock prices over time. Will change as the prices iterate.
